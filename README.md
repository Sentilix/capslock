# The CAPSLOCK Project

## About the CAPSLOCK Project
CAPSLOCK is an addon which helps Warlocks with summoning many people, like
before a raid for example.

CAPSLOCK introduce a summon queue, which raid members can join by typing
!summon in raid chat or by whisper.
All Warlocks with the addon installed can see the active queue.

When summoning, the Warlocks just click the Summon Next button. The addon
will automatically select the next target in the queue, so locks are not
attempting to summon same person.

Summon priority is given to other locks, so summoning can be optimized.
Also, the addon will check if target is eligible for a summon:

* Target must be online
* Target must be alive
* If lock is in an instance, the target must be in that instance as well!
* Also, there must be at least 2 other people in vicinity of the lock to assist with clicking the portal.



## About CAPSLOCK
The idea if the CAPSLOCK addon was originally launched by the Locks in the
Goldshire Golfclub guild on VanillaGaming as a copy of the resurrection addon
Thaliz - just for summoning.
